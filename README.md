# myFlix-client

This app is my approach of understanding how difficult it is to built websites such as Netflix. Hence, this is my mini version of it. As a user one can browse a list of movies, read their descriptions, as well as one can find out about their directors and genres.

As a logged-in user one can add one's profile as well as add and remove favorite movies. And one can add and remove favorite movies as well as update one's profile.

## Tools that I used

-   Javascript
-   React
